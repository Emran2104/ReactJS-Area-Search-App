React JS + Firebase (hosting)

This is a fairly simple and clean webapp, meant to be used mostly from mobile. Therefore the design is only made for the mobile user.

There is a search field where you can type specific three digit numbers ranging from 101 to 9xx (Not all numbers in between), which will display city names in Stockholm that is connected with that number.

This is a pet project, at the same time a better solution for a person I know who drives a cab in Sweden. They are currently using a book with list of all the cities and places with given number.
This app should be a better option for searching up where to drive for the cab driver. 

When the city name is displayed, there is a button that leads the user to Google Maps to that location, ready to start driving.
